PlantUML is a useful tool for creating a UML diagram in plain text.
With this tool, you can create a wide variety of UMLs, from a simple flowchart to a complex diagram.

There are many websites that can teach you how to create a PlantUML diagram, but when you first start you might run into some problems,

* I can’t remember the exact syntax… :(
* How can I create a more complex diagram?
* Are there any templates I can use instead of starting from scratch?

I’ve created the website [Real World PlantUML](https://real-world-plantuml.com/) to solve all of these issues!
